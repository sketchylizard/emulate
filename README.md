# EmuLate 🕰️

*Better late than never - A cycle-accurate 6502 emulator*

EmuLate is a multi-system emulator focused on the legendary 6502 microprocessor and the iconic computers that made it famous. While I may be fashionably late to the retro computing party, I'm hoping to learn something about writing cycle accurate emulators and have fun with some nostalgia.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Learn by doing**: Dive deep into emulator architecture and understand how these amazing machines actually worked
- **Relive the magic**: Recreate the Apple II experience that shaped my childhood and my career
- **Cycle-accurate emulation**: Build a precise 6502 CPU core that respects every clock cycle
- **Multi-platform vision**: Start with the Apple II, then expand to other 6502-powered legends

## 🚀 Current Status

**🍎 Apple II Series** - *In Development*
- Core 6502 CPU implementation
- Basic system architecture
- Memory mapping and I/O

**🔮 Future Plans**
- **Commodore 64** - The first computer that I bought with my own money
- **Nintendo Entertainment System**

## 🏗️ Architecture

EmuLate is designed with modularity in mind:

## 🎮 Why EmuLate?

This project was born from a deep appreciation for the Apple II computer that sparked my journey into technology. My dad bought our first Apple ][+ computer in December of 1979 and it transformed my life. I started reading the manuals that came with it and taught myself BASIC. After earning some money selling a computer program that I wrote in BASIC for that Apple, I used the money to buy myself a Commodore 64. I had dreams of producing a game on it that would make me a millionare that, sadly, never materialized, but I still have fond memories of both of those machines.

I realize that there are multiple Apple II emulators available, that run on several platforms, including web browsers. This is just a project for fun. If I get something working, and am still having fun, then I may extend it to support other platforms like the C64 or the NES, since they are similar machines.


## 🔧 Getting Started

*Coming soon! The project is in early development.*

## 🧪 Testing

EmuLate aims for accuracy through comprehensive testing:

- [Klaus Dormann's 6502 Test Suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)
- [Tom Harte's ProcessorTests](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/65x02)
- Custom validation against known-good behavior

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in:
- CPU core improvements
- System-specific implementations  
- Documentation
- Testing and validation
- Just sharing memories of these classic machines

Feel free to open issues, submit PRs, or start discussions about retro computing!
